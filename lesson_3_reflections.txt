• When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your stuff with other people, or just keep a safe remote copy.

• Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might want to work on changes on a local branches before pushing or viceversa

• Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks would create clones of GitHub repos, keeping a connection with the original repo.
I'd use them to create my own version of a complete repository.

Clones would create a copy of either a remote or local repository.
I'd use them to create my own version of another repository, without keeping track of the connection with the repo I cloned. E.g. if I'm using a third-party software I won't likely contribute to, but perhaps I'll change for my special needs.


Branches are different versions of the same repo that can be used to work on different
features without affecting the master branch.

I'd use them to work on specific features, without affecting the main branch and/or the work of other contributors.
