• How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By showing the previous and current version along each other


• How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By keeping track of changes in the very same file



• What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros of git: you keep track of logical changes
Cons of git: you can forget to commit


• Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because programming most always involves providing features in multiple files

• How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log displays a list of all the commits with IDs that I can use with git diff to compare two different versions, by using their IDs


• How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you can revert them back!


• Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For the Android course i’m about to start ^______^
