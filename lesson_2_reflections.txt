• What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Metadata get created in order to handle versioning


• How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It holds the files you wish to include in your next commit.
It allows to keep track of those files and add them one by one without having to select all the files at once (that can be painful for massive commits)
